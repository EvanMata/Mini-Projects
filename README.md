# Mini-Projects
Smaller individual projects:

Connect 4 (with ok AI algorithm)

Schelling House Segregation Model (With visualization)

Note: I have most of my coursework code, but my university forbids posting them online. This is due to students having found other former students work in the past. If you would like to see certain code projects, feel free to request them.
